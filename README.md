## üéØ Two Learning Approaches

### 1. **Before/After Comparison** (Recommended for beginners)
The `code.before.after/` directory provides clear side-by-side comparisons:
- **`.before.py`** - Traditional loop-based approach
- **`.after.py`** - Optimized vectorized version
- **Perfect for learning** - See exact transformations step by step

### 2. **Combined Examples** 
The `code/` directory contains comprehensive examples with both approaches in single files.

## üìã Covered Examples

- **Conditional Operations**: ReLU, clipping, and conditional masking
- **Euclidean Distance Calculation**: Pairwise distances between point sets
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: All-pairs shortest path optimization  
- **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: Dynamic programming vectorization
- **High-Dimensional Tensors**: Six-loop optimization using broadcasting
- **J-Integral Calculation**: Fracture mechanics computational optimization
- **Spring Energy Systems**: Pairwise interaction energy computation
